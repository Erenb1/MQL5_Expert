# 5ers Final Trading Bot

A sophisticated MQL5 Expert Advisor (EA) that implements a dual ALMA (Adaptive Linear Moving Average) crossover strategy with advanced risk management and trend confirmation.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dual ALMA Strategy**: Uses two ALMA indicators with different periods for trend identification
- **Smart Entry Logic**: Crossover detection with slope confirmation to reduce false signals
- **Advanced Risk Management**: ATR-based stop loss and take profit calculations
- **Distance Filter**: Prevents entries when price is too far from the slow ALMA
- **Reverse Crossover Protection**: Automatically closes positions on opposite crossover signals
- **Wait Mechanism**: Validates trade signals over multiple candles before execution
- **Trading Hours Control**: Configurable trading time windows
- **Custom Trade Manager**: Integrated position management system

## üìä Strategy Overview

The EA operates on a dual ALMA crossover system:

1. **Fast ALMA** (default: 27 period) - For entry signals
2. **Slow ALMA** (default: 150 period) - For trend direction and slope confirmation

### Entry Conditions
- **Long Entry**: Fast ALMA crosses above Slow ALMA + upward slope confirmation
- **Short Entry**: Fast ALMA crosses below Slow ALMA + downward slope confirmation
- Price must be within acceptable distance from Slow ALMA (ATR-based)
- No existing position on the symbol

### Exit Conditions
- Reverse crossover (automatic position closure)
- ATR-based stop loss and take profit levels

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters

### ALMA Settings
```mql5
input int alma_period = 27;        // Fast ALMA Period
input double sigma = 6.0;          // Fast ALMA Sigma
input double offset = 0.85;        // Fast ALMA Offset
input int alma_period2 = 150;      // Slow ALMA Period
input double sigma2 = 6.0;         // Slow ALMA Sigma
input double offset2 = 0.85;       // Slow ALMA Offset
```

### Risk Management
```mql5
input double atr_stopfactor = 0.5;    // Stop Loss (ATR multiplier)
input double atr_profitfactor = 1.3;  // Take Profit ratio
input double atr_distance = 2;        // Max distance from ALMA (ATR)
input double lot_size = 0.05;         // Position size
```

### Signal Validation
```mql5
input double slope_threshold = 1;     // Slope sensitivity (pips)
input int wait_candle = 3;           // Candles to wait for confirmation
```

### Trading Hours
```mql5
input int InpStartHour = 6;          // Trading start hour
input int InpStartMinute = 0;        // Trading start minute
input int InpEndHour = 23;           // Trading end hour
input int InpEndMinute = 58;         // Trading end minute
```
